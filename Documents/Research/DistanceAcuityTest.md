# [Visual Acuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity)


Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual processing system. VA, as it is sometimes referred to by optical professionals, is tested by requiring the person whose vision is being tested to identify so-called optotypes – stylized letters, Landolt rings, pediatric symbols, symbols for the illiterate, standardized Cyrillic letters in the Golovin–Sivtsev table, or other patterns – on a printed chart (or some other means) from a set viewing distance. 

In the expression 6/x vision, the numerator (6) is the distance in meters between the subject and the chart and the denominator (x) the distance at which a person with 6/6 acuity would discern the same optotype. Thus, 6/12 means that a person with 6/6 vision would discern the same optotype from 12 meters away (i.e. at twice the distance). This is equivalent to saying that with 6/12 vision, the person possesses half the spatial resolution and needs twice the size to discern the optotype.

* `Numerator`   = distance between the subject and the chart in meters 
* `Denominator` = distance at which a person with 6/6 acuity would discern the same optotype

## Formula 

Visual acuity is measured by a psychophysical procedure and as such relates the physical characteristics of a stimulus to a subject's percept and their resulting responses.

For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree).

```py
Acuity = 1 / gab
# gab in arc minutes
```

For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree).


### Snellen Notation
IXVisual acuity (V) can be written as a Snellen fraction (m/M) in which the numerator (m)
indicates the test distance and the denominator (M) indicates the distance at which the gap of
the equivalent Landolt ring subtends 1 minute of arc.

```m
          M       test distance in meters
Acuity =  ---- = -------------------------
          M       letter size in M-units
```


## Note

The visual acuity test is used to determine the smallest letters you can read on a standardized chart 6 meters away. Special charts are used when testing at distances shorter than 6 meters. 

Visual acuity alone thus cannot determine the overall quality of visual function.

Acuity is a measure of visual performance and does not relate to the eyeglass prescription required to correct vision.

Subjects with 6/6 vision or "better" (20/15, 20/10, etc.) may still benefit from an eyeglass correction for other problems related to the visual system, such as hyperopia, ocular injuries, or presbyopia.

## Test

The precise distance at which acuity is measured is not important as long as it is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears.

### Two Eyes

### Left Eye / Right Eye

You will be asked to cover one eye with the palm of your hand, a piece of paper, or a small paddle while you read out loud the smallest line of letters you can see on the chart. .



## [Interpretation (EN ISO 8596)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity#cite_note-11)

Once measured, visual acuity findings must be interpreted. It is recognized that the intended interpretation of the measurement may influence the choice of measurement technique. 

Some possible interpretations of visual acuity measurement include its use:

  (1) To aid the `clinician` during the course of refraction and to verify the optimal correction of refractive errors;

  (2) As a screening device (e.g., school tests) to suggest the presence or absence of `ocular abnormalities`;

  (3) To monitor the `effects of disease`, its course and/or its treatment;

  (4) To determine the `visual aids` needed for certain tasks for individuals with normal vision and for those with subnormal vision;

  (5) To estimate an individual's `ability to perform certain tasks` (e.g prior to issuance of a `driver's license`).


### Purpose of the Standard

1. The purpose of this document is to define a standardized method and standardized stimulus conditions for the clinical measurement of visual acuity at photopic levels with `high contrast` optotypes.

2. This standard, an international one, is intended to encourage increased uniformity in
testing of visual acuity as part of the routine office ophthalmic examination. Considering the
vast array of optotypes in use worldwide, as well as the diversity in methods of presentation,
one must accept the fact that full compliance with an international visual acuity standard,
however desirable, may be difficult to achieve and, if achieved, will only be achieved slowly

## Clinical Visual Acuity

*  The visual acuity score of an individual should express the reciprocal of the angular size of the critical detail within the
smallest optotype that can be correctly recognized by that individual. 

* "Clinical visual acuity," as measured in the routine office ophthalmic examination, is defined in this standard as a measurement of the ability to recognize black, high-contrast optotypes on a white background.

*  The patient will utilize recognition and interpretation clues, based on familiarity with such elements as letters and digits; thus, the visual resolution threshold implied in letter recognition measurements is influenced by optotype familiarity.

## Manufacture

*  Manufacturers and designers make charts with optotype sizes in steps of constant ratio (geometric progression); and that:
*  This ratio is to be 1:100.1 or 1:1.2589. This ratio is also referred to as 0.1 log unit (base10). Dimensions to be Used for the
Preparation of Landolt Rings for use at 4 m.
* It is highly desirable that chart designers or manufacturers provide at least 5 optotype presentations of each size, to be displayed on a single line, if possible.
* The distance between adjacent optotypes on charts must not be less than the width of an optotype. In the interest of uniformity, an upper limit to the lateral spacing that is equal to twice the specified lower limit is suggested.
* It is desirable that constant space-to-optotype size ratios be maintained throughout the
acuity chart so that the difficulty of the visual task is uniform at all measurement levels.

## Testing Standard

* It is suggested that the standard testing distance be 4 meters. Metric specification is desirable and preferred. Clinical testing at longer distances (e.g., 5 meters and 6 meters) is accepted.
